# actions

This is designed as a tool for causal and terminological reasoning about actions in action plans. That is, given an action-type ontology, an action-domain specification, and an action plan, the tool will determine under which actions types each of the actions in the action plan falls.

The tool is originally motivated by the desire to modeling the phenomena that an action can be described in very different terms. For instance, consider the Trolley Problem (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem). The act of pulling the lever can be described as just pulling a lever, or as an act of killing one person, or as an act of rescuing the lives of five persons.
